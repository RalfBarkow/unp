=======================

Hierarchical User Interface Component Architecture (HUICA)<br/>
Example Application

About
-----

Units and Persons (UnP) is a small example application showcasing the
Hierarchical User Interface Component Architecture (HUICA) with the help
of technology stack based on GemstoneJS and GraphQL-IO. UnP is large
enough to be able to show various aspects of HUICA and small enough to
be still easy to comprehend.
